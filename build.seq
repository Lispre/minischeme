; To build the 'miniscm' executable using DICE C
; under AmigaDOS 1.3, you can either run
;
;   protect build.seq srwd
;   build.seq
;
; or you can simply type the following commands into the shell.
;
; NOTE, you seem to need a lot of RAM to build this!
; I started E-UAE with `-c8 -b4` (4M Chip Mem 1M Slow Mem).

dcc -DBSD miniscm.c -o miniscm
